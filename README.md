You can embed [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/everything), with both video and chat. People have to log through Twitch to participate?

YouTube chat can't be embedded, but could be hooked up to a custom chat client through API see [stackoverflow]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52468303/how-to-embed-youtube-livestream-chat"). An NPM package exists for [Twitch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-chat-client).

[This](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-chat-react) might be useful.

local development: `npm run dev`  
deploy: `now`
